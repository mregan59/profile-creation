Regardless, my faith has been very important to me, and despite not being regularly in attendance, maintaining a Christian life has always been a priority.\r\nI had tried a few times to get into regular Mass attendence, but found that the Parishes I'd tried weren't very compelling to me. I was recommended a Latin Mass Parish and immediately was drawn to the symbolism and tradition, and I've been learning more about the faith and trying to keep regular attendance since.",

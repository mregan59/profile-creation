I’ve been on a kind of internal journey this past year where I’m realizing more strengths I didn’t know I had and working on a way to exhibit those within my life.\n\n  I’m a tax accountant by trade, something I somewhat excel at, but I have felt a sort of void within those roles that I recognized this past year.  I am working towards fulfilling myself in more meaningful ways outside of just my work or my career.\n\nAs for me I’m relatively easy going as long as I’m not hangry - nutri-grain and chewy bars come highly recommended and snickers bars for emergencies only. I think I’m very very funny, people tell me I am I promise, but I would say it’s a 70/30 split of laughing at me vs laughing with me.  I enjoy and prefer quality time and intimate setting with people but can also hang out at a venue/bar even though I may get tired at like 10:30 ????.  I’m very open minded and really pride myself on trying to see where people are coming from. I believe in compromise and sacrifice if someone else really holds something valuable in their life, and I believe in making room for multiple opinions to exist within a relationship - most decisions can be made through dialogue and understanding what is really cornerstone to each individuals life and values.  That’s kind of a basic personality outline, all my quirky weird humor and personality can be better outlined in person.\n\nI enjoy sports, I collect whiskey, and I hunt about once a year. I enjoy time outside despite it never being my first option. Recently began working out regularly so Orange Theory membership would be a huge plus to do workouts together.",

I like eating, going out and staying in (depends if it’s raining).\n\n-I have no niños \n\n-Im active and like being outside on the grill.\n\n-I’m single, bilingual and ready to mingle from Monday to Domingo.\n\nI believe the structure of family plays a big role in who we are as adults and how we function in our society. I think the person you are with, is the person that shares your same values for a future built for the both of you. \n\nI enjoy working around the house, my mom’s house and also helping those around me with what I can. I also like to venture outside, go on long drives and see new things I’ve yet to experience. \n\nI served my country in the US Marine Corps for 4 years and it has deeply impacted my view of the world. I gained discipline and structure in my life because of it. \n\nI take into consideration the upbringing my parents gave in a Catholic household. I have gained a lot of understanding of what being in a family setting and see the benefits of living in a supportive environment. \n\nEnjoying the company of the people around you and having memorable experiences are things that I want to build with in a relationship.",
